**__Optimal Yahtzee strategy research__**

This research is to research the different strategies of Yahtzee in preparation to implement a CPU for single players

**[Basic strategy](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~mec/2006-2007/Probability/Yahtzee.htm)**
* this was a good article to get the basics of Yahtzee strategy 
* it summarizes some basic tips such as filling in the 1's and 2's box if all the other boxes give low scores or always trying to get a yahtzee early on in the game
* also gives some advanced strategy near the bottom and gives a formula for the average score you will roll

**[Research paper on best strategies](https://www.yahtzeemanifesto.com/optimal-yahtzee.pdf)**
* very informative paper that gives:
    * the main purpose of the paper -> to measure different strategies against each other to find the best one
    * background on the games rules and the optimal strategy that will test
    * how they went about testing the optimal strategy
    * gives the results of the optimal strategy as well as other strategies by displaying the average total score of each
* all in all a good research paper that we could use to implement a CPU for single player
